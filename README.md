ZCI Simple Web App with Codeigniter
===================================

Hi! First off all. Sorry for the English. I'm Anton Zekeriev Rodin (www.azr.es) Spanish Web Developer. This is my contribution
for Codeigniter Community. All this time I wanted to create a simple and standard web APP with CI. This APP allow me to start any
site from something Standard.

This is a Zkeleton a Codeigniter APP that includes:

Codeigniter 2.1.4
HMVC for CI from Wiredesign
Internalization Library i18n (Now I'am working on Spanish and Russian translate)
Very simple Auth Library (You can easy change or replace it)
Twitter Bootstrap Template 3.0.0 RC1
JQuery 1.10.2


I'am currently working in some modules that can be added in one minutes... like catalogue, contact form, simple CMS system.
My Idea is not to build a CMS, is provide a Skeleton APP for start to build any web app.

The official site for this APP is www.zci.es

Licence or something Like this. I have no IDEA what I'm doing :-)
